Analysis of the Wine Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

Python-Ahalysis_of_wine_quality
Analysis of the Wine Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This project has the same structure as the Distribution of craters on Mars project.

Data
The two data sets containing physicochemical and sensory characteristics of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine were taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. These data sets are the courtesy of Paulo Cortez.

There are 1599 samples of red wine and 4898 samples of white wine in the data sets. Each wine sample (row) has the following characteristics (columns):

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (score between 0 and 10)
Goals and work flow
By the means of data management, visualization, analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning, I explore the relationships and correlations between the wine characteristics and its quality score. The main focus of this work is to try different predictive algorithms on the data and examine the resutls.

The work flows through the following sections:

Data management and visualization
Data analysis
Regression modeling
Machine learning
